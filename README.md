This problem focuses on the challenges of social choice when there are n (=5 )alternatives, say {a, b, c, d, e}. Consider the following social choice function where (i) each individual provides a ranking of the alternatives and (ii) each alternative receives a number of votes for each first, second, third, fourth and fifth place ranking. The number of votes for each alternative is calculated as follows:  # of Votes = 10 × (# 1st Place Rankings) + 5 × (# 2nd Place Rankings) + 4 × (# 3rd Place Rankings)+ 3 × (# 3rd Place Rankings)+ 1 × (# 3rd Place Rankings) Now apply the concept above to a Base Station location  problem. Where  there are 5 alternative locations are there for each cell and there are 100 base station to be located. Operators use public voting to find the best location. Consider there is a 10 lakh people reside in the city.  Write a suitable MATLAB code to solve the problem and find the selected location.
